# Motivation

Food waste is a serious problem in the United States. According to the Food and Drug Administration, around 30-40 percent of the food supply is discarded. FreshFridge aims to help mitigate that waste by offering users the ability to minimize their personal food waste. A shopping list generates a digital "refrigerator" that lists the expiration date of each item that has been crossed off the user's shopping list. 

A user may log into the FreshFridge app and enter items into their shopping list. Once the item is checked off the list, their "refrigerator" will display the expiration date for each item. 

# Description

The app uses the following technologies:
* [NodeMailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/), a module for Node.js applications to allow easy as cake email sending. 
* Backed by a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database. 
* Utilizes GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes for retrieving, adding, changing and removing data.
* [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-jwt/) authentication with a JSON web token. 

See images below for screenshots of the app, and [here](https://fresh-fridge-project3.herokuapp.com/) is a link to use the app.
